                    Hochhuth Consulting uses an agile task management tool to
                    distribute tasks and assignments. Through this, all jobs and
                    the resulting tasks, whether from customers or internally,
                    are collected and prioritized. Tasks are distributed
                    according to expertise, interest, challenge and
                    availability. The task management allows for work to be done
                    flexibly in the office, in the home office or in the most
                    beautiful places in the world.
